This project comprises an automated test suite developed using the Behave framework to assess the functionalities of the Magento Software Testing Board platform. 
The suite incorporates tests for critical features such as adding items to the cart, editing the cart, user login, placing orders, registering new accounts, searching for products, and submitting reviews.
Each feature undergoes rigorous testing through various scenarios to ensure its proper functionality under diverse conditions. The tests simulate user interactions with the platform to validate its behavior accurately.


Key Features Tested:
•	Add to Cart: Validates the process of adding items to the shopping cart, including search and selection functionality.
•	Edit Cart: Ensures the ability to modify or remove items from the shopping cart.
•	User Login: Verifies the authentication process for users, including error handling.
•	Order Placement: Tests the process of placing an order on the platform, covering product selection and checkout.
•	User Registration: Validates the registration process for new users, including form submission and confirmation.
•	Product Search: Ensures the functionality of the search feature, including input validation and result display.
•	Submit a Review: Tests the ability of users to submit reviews for products, including form submission and feedback messages.


Testing Methodology:
•	Utilizes the Behave framework for automated testing.
•	Test scenarios are articulated in Gherkin syntax for readability and maintainability.
•	Thorough validation of each feature's behavior to detect issues or regressions early in the development cycle.
•	Detailed test reports generated for easy tracking and analysis.


Purpose:
•	Ensure the reliability and functionality of the Magento Software Testing Board platform across various key features.
•	Streamline the testing process and minimize manual efforts.
•	Detect issues or regressions early in the development cycle to facilitate prompt resolution.
•	Improve overall user experience and satisfaction on the platform.
