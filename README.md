This project comprises an automated test suite developed using the Behave framework to assess the functionalities of the Magento Software Testing Board platform. The suite incorporates tests for critical features such as adding items to the cart, editing the cart, user login, placing orders, registering new accounts, searching for products, and submitting reviews.

Each feature undergoes rigorous testing through various scenarios to ensure its proper functionality under diverse conditions. The tests simulate user interactions with the platform to validate its behavior accurately.

The project makes use of Behave, a behavior-driven development (BDD) tool for Python, and employs Gherkin syntax to articulate test scenarios in a human-readable format. Detailed test reports are generated to facilitate comprehension and monitoring of test outcomes.
